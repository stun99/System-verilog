The folder consist of a simple 5 stage pipeling design where we have implemented the 5 types of operations OP_ADD: Performs addition, OP_SUB: Performs Subtraction, OP_AND: Logical AND, OP_OR: Logical OR and OP_XOR: Logical XOR which are written in ece571_alu.sv and package ece571_cpu_pkg.sv contains parameter to define the ALU inputs widths, enumeration data type for defining opcodes, structure that contains instructions to be sent to ALU and ece571_cpu.sv consists of Pipelined Logic (when reset is asserted, all pipe data resets to 0, else for every clock cycle it will fetch instruction/data from one pipe-stage to other) Simple pipe-stage.
