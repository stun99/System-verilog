The memory.sv file consist a simple SRAM memory implementation, where each transaction happens in the positive edge of the clock cycle. There are two testbenches for this code where tb.sv consist simple read and write checks, whereas the backdoor_tb.sv checks for (all the combinations of frontdoor access and backdoor access like test_fd_write_fd_read, test_fd_write_bd_read, test_bd_write_fd_read and test_bd_write_bd_read.
